      "Linear models are widely used to help price securities and perform optimal portfolio allocation, among other useful things. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the significance of linearity in financial modelling is its assurance that a problem terminates at a global optimal solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modules such as the **SciPy** and **NumPy** packages contain a variety of linear regression functions for data scientists to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In traditional portfolio management, the allocation of assets fllows a linear pattern, and investors have individual styles of investing. We can state the problem of portfolio allocation into a system of linear equations, containning either equalities or inequalities. These linear systems can then be represented in a matrix form as $Ax=B$, where $A$ is the known coefficients, $B$ is the observed result, and $x$ is the vector of values to find out. More often, $x$ contains the optimal security weights to maximize the agent's utility. Using matrix algebra, we can efficiently solve for $x$ using either direct or indirect methods."
